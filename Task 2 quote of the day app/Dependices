Run the App
Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

The app displays a random quote from the predefined list, which updates when you click "Refresh Quote."

This app uses an offline array of quotes. You can expand it by integrating an API (e.g., https://type.fit/api/quotes) for dynamic quotes.
